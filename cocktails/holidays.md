## Shopping List

If you are in the Bay Area: [Alkali Rye](https://sipalkalirye.com/) and [Bitters & Bottles](https://www.bittersandbottles.com/) are great liqor shops to buy from.
For Bay Area and Portland if you want clear ice, check out [Blind Tiger Ice](https://www.blindtigerice.com/) and [PDX Ice](https://pdxice.com/).

### With Alcohol
- 100g sweetened condensed milk (I haven't tried sweetened condensed coconut milk but it could be a vegan replacement)
- 1 bottle of Martinelli's Sparkling Cider (you won't need the entire bottle. If you can't get Martinelli's try getting unsweetened apple juice and sparkling/soda water)
- 4-5 limes
- vanilla extract (vanilla extract contains alcohol, but you are only using a drop or two, you can alternatively get vanilla sugar or vanilla pods)
- graham crackers
- 4oz Bourbon (I typically use Four Roses or Bulleit)
- 150g white sugar
- 3-4 lemons
- 1oz dry vermouth (Dolin Dry Vermouth offers smaller bottles)
- 4oz Rye Whiskey (Bulleit for example)
- Old Fashioned Bitters (from Fee Brothers. Alternatively basic Angostura bitters)
- 1/2 bottle of Glühwein or another mulled wine (Check your local [World Market](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/wintersaison-gluhwein.do), Total Wine or Trader Joes. Alternatively there are great recipes online)
- if you have some whole cloves around great set a few aside :)

Notes: If you don't want left over alcohol, you can often get smaller bottles at liquor shops. You can also get either Bourbon or Rye and use it in both recipes. In that case get enough for 8oz. Bourbon is typically sweeter than Rye so I'd opt for Rye in this case.

### Alcohol Free
- 100g sweetened condensed milk (I haven't tried sweetened condensed coconut milk but it could be a vegan replacement)
- 1 bottle of Martinelli's Sparkling Cider (you won't need the entire bottle. If you can't get Martinelli's try getting unsweetened apple juice and sparkling/soda water)
- 4-5 limes
- vanilla extract (vanilla extract contains alcohol, but you are only using a drop or two, you can alternatively get vanilla sugar or vanilla pods)
- graham crackers
- 150g demerara or turbinado sugar
- 5-6 lemons
- 1/2 bottle of alcohol free Glühwein or another mulled wine (Check your local [World Market](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/wintersaison-gluhwein.do), [Total Wine](https://www.totalwine.com/wine/dessert-fortified-wine/spiced-wine/wintertraum-gluhwein/p/14759010) or Trader Joes. Alternatively there are great recipes online. Verjus is a good basis for alcohol-free Glühwein).

## Equipment

### the kitchen basics version:

- a vessel for shaking. If you have a shaker great, otherwise a mason jar or a hydroflask should do the job. As long as it can fit ice as well as ~8oz of liquid
- a strainer
- a spoon
- a tall glass
- glassware to serve your drinks in
- something to measure. I'll be using oz as measurements in the workshop but provide equivalents in cl in the recipes
- ice (not crushed ice but supermarket/bodega ice is fine as long as it has bigger chunks)

### if you have cocktail equipment:

- a shaker + strainer
- a mixing glass and bar spoon
- a jigger
- double old fashioned glass
- champagne flute
- cocktail coup or nick & nora glass
- ice (not crushed ice) and two big blocks of ice for serving

## Base Ingredients
### Glühwein Reduction
- 375ml of Glühwein - purchased (at [World Market](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/wintersaison-gluhwein.do) or [Total Wine](https://www.totalwine.com/wine/dessert-fortified-wine/spiced-wine/wintertraum-gluhwein/p/14759010) or [homemade](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-german-gluhwein-238371), optionally alcohol-free with Verjus

Place Glühwein into a put and place on low heat onto the stove and heat up until reduced by half. Higher heat can speed up the process but be careful to not bring it to a boil to avoid a change in taste. Bottle and store in the fridge.

### Simple Syrup / Sugar Syrup
- 100g white sugar
- 100g warm water

Mix ingredients together until dissolved. Bottle and store in the fridge.

### Vanilla Syrup
Take some of your simple syrup and mix with a few drops of vanilla extract or other source of vanilla until you have a vanilla flavor without it being overpowering.
Sweetened Condensed Milk Stock
- 100g sweetened condensed milk (or sweetened condensed coconut milk)
- 100g warm water
- 2g salt

Mix ingredients until properly mixed. Bottle and store in the fridge.

## Cocktails
### Apple Pie Mimosa (non-alcoholic)
This cocktail is a modification of the Aviary's Key Lime Pie Mimosa turned non-alcoholic. 

- 1oz (30ml) sweetened condensed milk stock
- 3/4oz (22.5ml) lime juice
- 1/2oz (15ml) vanilla syrup
- 3oz (90ml) of Martinelli's sparkling apple cider
- 1 graham cracker

Add all ingredients except the apple cider into a shaker and shake over ice. Pour into a champagne flute or similar glass and top up with the apple cider. Grate graham cracker over cocktail for garnish.

### Winter in Manhattan (contains alcohol)
One of my favorite cocktails is a classic Manhattan. This cocktail is a twist on it but bringing classic winter flavors into play.

- 2oz (60ml) Rye Whiskey
- 1oz (30ml) Glühwein reduction
- 1/2oz (15ml) Dry Vermouth
- 1tsp simple syrup
- 1 dash Angostura bitters
- 2 dash Old Fashioned bitters
- Garnish: Orange peel and whole cloves

Add all ingredients into a glass with ice and stir until chilled (20-30 sec). Strain into cocktail glass, express the orange peel over it, add holes in the orange peel and add 3-4 whole cloves in it. Add on top of the cocktail.

### Sour Christmas (contains alcohol)
I love New York Sours and when I was cooking a Christmas dinner last year with my partner we were experimenting with using a Glühwein reduction in a pan sauce. When it came to making a cocktail to accompany it, I went with this twist on a New York sour. 

- 2oz (60ml) Bourbon
- 3/4oz (22.5ml) lemon juice
- 3/4oz (22.5ml) simple syrup
- 1/2oz (15ml) Glühwein reduction

Shake all ingredients except the Glühwein reduction in a shaker with ice. Strain into a double old fashioned glass with ice and float the Glühwein reduction on top.

### Sour Christmas (0% ABV)
If you want to try the cocktail above but don't want to consume alcohol, you got two options. The closest you can get to this, is by using a non-alcoholic spirit such as Ritual Whiskey Alternative. It hits a lot of the same notes as a Bourbon (incl. the burn). But if that's not your jam or you don't want to spend money, this is the recipe for you. Since we lose the complexity from the Bourbon, we are swapping the simple syrup for a richer version using Demerara syrup.

- 1.5oz (45ml) lemon juice
- 1.5oz (45ml) Demerara syrup (same ratio as simple syrup)
- splash of water (or shake really long)
- 1/2oz (15ml) - 3/4oz (22.5ml) Glühwein reduction (from non-alcoholic Glühwein)

Shake all ingredients except the Glühwein reduction in a shaker with ice. Strain into a double old fashioned glass with ice and float the Glühwein reduction on top.
